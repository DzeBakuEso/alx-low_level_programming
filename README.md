## Tasks Overview

### 0. Object-like Macro
**Objective:**  
Create a header file defining a macro `SIZE` as `1024`. The `main` program will use this macro to compute and print `98 + SIZE`.

### 1. Pi
**Objective:**  
Create a header file defining a macro `PI` as `3.14159265359`. The `main` program calculates and prints the area of a circle with radius `98` using this macro.

### 2. File name
**Objective:**  
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from using the `__FILE__` macro.

### 3. Function-like Macro
**Objective:**  
Create a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of `x`. The `main` program demonstrates this by calculating and printing the absolute values of `-98` and `98` multiplied by `10`.

### 4. SUM
**Objective:**  
Create a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of `x` and `y`. The `main` program calculates and prints the sum of `98` and `1024`.
