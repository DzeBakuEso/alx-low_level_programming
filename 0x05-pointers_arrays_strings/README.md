# Project: 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

## Description of Tasks

### 0. 98 Battery st.
- **File:** 0-reset_to_98.c  
- **Prototype:** `void reset_to_98(int *n);`

  This function takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### 1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream
- **File:** 1-swap.c  
- **Prototype:** `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

  This function swaps the values of two integers passed as pointers.

### 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read
- **File:** 2-strlen.c  
- **Prototype:** `int _strlen(char *s);`

  This function returns the length of a string (not including the terminating null byte `\0`).

### 3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them
- **File:** 3-puts.c  
- **Prototype:** `void _puts(char *str);`

  This function prints a string followed by a new line to the standard output.

### 4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear
- **File:** 4-print_rev.c  
- **Prototype:** `void print_rev(char *s);`

  This function prints a string in reverse followed by a new line.

### 5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes
- **File:** 5-rev_string.c  
- **Prototype:** `void rev_string(char *s);`

  This function reverses a string in place.

### 6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true
- **File:** 6-puts2.c  
- **Prototype:** `void puts2(char *str);`

  This function prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### 7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half
- **File:** 7-puts_half.c  
- **Prototype:** `void puts_half(char *str);`

  This function prints the second half of a string. If the string length is odd, it prints the last `(length_of_the_string - 1) / 2` characters.

### 8. Arrays are not pointers
- **File:** 8-print_array.c  
- **Prototype:** `void print_array(int *a, int n);`

  This function prints `n` elements of an array of integers, separated by commas and spaces.

### 9. strcpy
- **File:** 9-strcpy.c  
- **Prototype:** `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`

  This function copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte `\0`, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. It returns a pointer to `dest`.
