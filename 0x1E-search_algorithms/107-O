# Time Complexity of Jump Search in a Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list of size `n`, using jump search with a step size of `sqrt(n)`:

- The algorithm makes `sqrt(n)` jumps to find a block that contains the target.
- Once the block is found, a linear search is performed within that block, taking at most `sqrt(n)` comparisons.

Thus, the overall average time complexity is:

**O(sqrt(n))**

This time complexity is derived by considering both the jump steps and the linear search within the block.
